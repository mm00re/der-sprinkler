der-sprinkler
=============

An arduino controlled sprinkler system featuring environmental controls based on local weather sensors

I'll occasionally update this to reflect changes I make to the system.

It's not a new concept but I can't stand the systems that are out there, insofar as they don't make me want to own one of them.

There is a working concept called opensprinkler that I very much like but it's not as sophisticated as I would like.

Mine may nowhere near approach the functionality but if it works for me the exact way I want it to then all is well.
