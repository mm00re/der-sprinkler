Update 1.  With plans to use a DS1307 RTC I have now been able to successfully set the correct time and be able to pull time and display it on the screen of the LCD.

The LCD only has 4 pins in use. +5, Gnd, +5(backlight)from pin 53 at the moment and pin 14 used on the Mega for serial communication sent to the display

Commands are sent to the LCD via the Serial.Write(); function with the number in the perenthesis being the desired command.

The current issue I  am having is sending a command with extra values to the display.  For instance the command to control
contrast is Serial.write(17) which must somehow be followed by the value between 0 and 100 or to change the location of the cursor on the screen
to /021/010/001

Update 2. Figured out the issue with sending commands to the LCD, by using a function it is pretty simple, thanks to the support team over at CrystalFontz for that info.
Also, my parts finally came in from China(Singapore) so now I have mt temp/humidity sensor, keypad and tri-color lcd's.
Now to get to work.

I have the RTC working properly now and the system will poll it whenever it restarts otherwise it doesn't apply power to the pin because the RTC already has a battery so I see no need in constantly applying power.
